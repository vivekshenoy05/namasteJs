## üìå Callbacks

### ‚úÖ Benefits of Callbacks

- Helps in handling asynchronous operations.
- Allows functions to be passed as arguments and executed later.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Drawbacks of Callbacks

1. **Callback Hell**  
   Nested callbacks make code difficult to read and maintain.

2. **Inversion of Control**  
   You lose control of the flow when you pass your callback to another function, especially if it decides **when**, **how many times**, or **whether at all** to call it.
